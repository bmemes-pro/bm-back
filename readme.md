# Blockchain Memes Protocol
The project's core concept is to implement mechanisms of writing/reading social information in blockchain transactions: firstly, posts (text + images + other stuff), likes, replies, payouts, following, etc. Your wallet is your user.  
  
For now, we've chosen blockchain [💎TON ↗️](https://ton.org/) because it's fast, reliable, and not expensive.  
  
We believe in decentralization and victory over censorship ✊
